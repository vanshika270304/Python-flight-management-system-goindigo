Welcome to the GitHub repository for the GOINDIGO Flight Management System!

Project Overview:
GOINDIGO Flight Management System is a Python-based application that empowers passengers to seamlessly manage their flight reservations, access boarding passes, purchase in-flight amenities, provide feedback, and track flight progress. This open-source project was developed between May 2020 and February 2021 with the goal of enhancing the air travel experience for passengers.

Key Features:

Flight Reservation: Passengers can easily book and cancel flight reservations, providing a convenient and flexible booking experience.

Boarding Pass Access: The system allows passengers to access digital boarding passes using Tkinter GUI, reducing the need for paper tickets and enhancing efficiency at the airport.

Amenities Purchase: Passengers can select and purchase in-flight amenities, making it easier to plan for a comfortable journey.

Feedback Submission: Passengers can offer feedback on their flight experiences, helping airlines improve their services.

Precise Data Management: Flight-related information is managed and visualized with precision using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

Data Integrity: Efficient CSV storage and retrieval mechanisms ensure data integrity, providing a reliable and secure environment for passenger information.
